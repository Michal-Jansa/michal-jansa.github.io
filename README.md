# Portfolio Website

This website was created to publish personal data analytics projects. 

It is built upon **"Dimension"**, a responsive template by HTML5 UP (aj@lkn.io | @ajlkn), which is free for personal and commercial use under the [CCA 3.0 license](html5up.net/license). Only neccessary changes were made to this template's code to adapt the template to newly added content.

<br>

## Modifications

In **main.css**

- Resized (widened) article panels used to display project descriptions
- Resized (widened) the menu buttons and reduced their letter spacing
- Set image opacity to 0

In **index.html**

- Renamed and reduced the number of menu elements
- Adjusted text heading sizes and formatting
- Justified paragraphs for a clean layout
- Replaced original placeholder text with project descriptions
- Added images and links to project descriptions
- Updated main page text and footer text

Most changes were made manually using HTML. The rest of the template code remains untouched.

Dimension by HTML5 UP

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
